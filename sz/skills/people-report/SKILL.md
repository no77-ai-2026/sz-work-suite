# people-report

## 스킬 개요(상세)

인사 리포트 — 헤드카운트·이직률·조직 건강 지표 보고서를 생성합니다. 한국 표준 + UZ 듀얼 컨텍스트를 적용합니다.

**한국화 노트**: 다양성 지표는 한국 실무 맥락(고령자·장애인 고용 의무 등)으로 재구성.

**도구 일반화**: 원문의 미국 SaaS 연동은 방법론으로만 계승한다 — 한국 실무에서는 연결된 커넥터·업로드 문서·사용자 제공 정보를 소스로 쓴다.

**UZ 컨텍스트**: UZ: 현지 채용 비율(로컬라이제이션)·급여 통화 구성을 지표에 추가. 상세는 `references/uz-people-report.md`.
