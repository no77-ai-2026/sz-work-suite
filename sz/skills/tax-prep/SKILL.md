# tax-prep

## 스킬 개요(상세)

사업자 세무자료 준비 — 분기 예정신고 추정 또는 연말 자료를 정리해 세무사 인계 패킷을 만듭니다. 한국 표준 + UZ 듀얼 컨텍스트를 적용합니다.

**한국화 노트**: 원본 tax-season-organizer 병합. 한국 재맥락: 부가세 확정(1·7월)·예정(4·10월), 종합소득세(5월), 세금계산서·현금영수증 증빙. [경계] 세법 질의는 sz:tax-helper, 근로자 연말정산은 personal-tax-saver(미포함).

**도구 일반화**: 원문의 미국 SaaS 연동(QuickBooks·HubSpot·PayPal·Gusto 등)은 방법론으로만 계승한다 — 한국 실무에서는 스마트스토어·카페24 MCP(gil-commerce 설치 시), 엑셀/CSV 업로드, 사용자 제공 수치를 소스로 쓰고, 해당 커넥터가 연결된 경우에만 직접 조회한다.

**UZ 컨텍스트**: UZ: NDS 월 신고·이익세/매출세(소규모 특례) 구분, soliq. 상세는 `references/uz-tax-prep.md`.

## 원문 방법론 (EN, knowledge-work-plugins)

<!-- source: small-business/tax-prep -->
Run the tax prep workflow using the `tax-season-organizer` skill. Act immediately — the user typed /tax-prep, so skip the discovery phase.

Parse arguments:
- `--mode` (default: infer from date — Q1-Q3 defaults to `quarterly`, Q4/Jan defaults to `both`) — `quarterly` for estimated tax payment, `1099` for year-end 1099-NEC prep, `both` for combined
- `--year` (default: current year)

**Framing:** Open every deliverable with "Prepared for review by your accountant — not tax advice."

## Step 1 — Determine mode

If `--mode` was not provided:
1. Check the current date. If Oct–Jan, default to `both`. Otherwise default to `quarterly`.
2. Confirm with the owner: "Based on the time of year, I'll prepare [mode]. Want me to do something different?"

## Step 2 — Quarterly estimated tax (if mode includes quarterly)

1. Pull YTD Profit & Loss from QuickBooks (Jan 1 through last completed quarter).
2. If QuickBooks is not connected, ask the user to paste net income or upload a CSV.
3. Ask: "How much have you already paid in estimated taxes this year?"
4. Calculate: SE tax, adjusted net income, federal income tax estimate (default 22% bracket), quarterly payment due.
5. State every assumption explicitly — bracket, business type, exclusions.
6. Deliver the formatted estimate with the due date for the current quarter.

## Step 3 — Year-end 1099 prep (if mode includes 1099)

1. Pull contractor/vendor payments from all connected sources: QuickBooks, PayPal, Stripe.
2. Aggregate by payee across sources. Flag likely duplicates for human review — never auto-merge.
3. Apply the $600 threshold. Flag near-threshold payees ($400–$599).
4. Check W-9 status in QuickBooks for each flagged payee.
5. Deliver the 1099-NEC candidate list with missing W-9 action items and the PayPal/Stripe 1099-K overlap note.

## Approval gates

- **Not tax advice.** State this in every output header.
- **State every assumption.** Bracket, business type, excluded deductions — give the accountant the levers.
- **Don't merge payees automatically.** Flag duplicates for human review.
- **Don't file anything.** Output is prep material only.

## Output

End with a next-steps checklist for the accountant: missing W-9s to collect, assumptions to verify, deadlines to hit.

# Tax Season Organizer

> **Framing:** This skill produces prep material for a CPA, not tax advice. Say so early
> and state every assumption explicitly so the accountant can adjust.

## Quick start

Determine which mode the user needs, pull the relevant data, calculate or compile,
and deliver a structured document the accountant can work from directly.

```
User: "what do I owe for estimated taxes this quarter?"
→ Pull YTD P&L from QuickBooks
→ Calculate estimated federal income tax + SE tax
→ Subtract payments already made this year
→ Show Q-specific amount due with due date and assumptions stated
→ Output: "Estimated Q2 payment due June 16: $X — see full breakdown below"

User: "I need to send out 1099s"
→ Pull all contractor/vendor payments from QuickBooks + PayPal + Stripe
→ Identify contractors paid ≥ $600 YTD
→ Flag records missing W-9 / EIN
→ Output: 1099-NEC candidate list + missing W-9 action list
```

## Determine mode

Read the user's message and context to decide which path applies:

- **Quarterly estimate** — keywords: estimated payment, quarterly taxes, how much to set aside, safe harbor, Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4
- **Year-end 1099 prep** — keywords: 1099, 1099-NEC, year-end, contractors, W-9, send 1099s, file 1099s
- **Combined** — some users will ask "year-end summary" and need both. Run quarterly last; run 1099 prep first since it drives the most action items.

If the intent is ambiguous, ask: "Are you looking at your estimated tax payment for this quarter, or are you preparing 1099s for your contractors — or both?"

## Path 1: Quarterly estimated tax

### 1. Pull YTD financials

Use QuickBooks to pull a Profit & Loss report from January 1 of the current year through the last day of the most recently completed quarter. Capture:
- **Gross revenue** (total income)
- **Total expenses** (operating expenses, COGS, etc.)
- **Net ordinary income** = revenue − expenses

If QuickBooks is not connected, ask the user to upload a P&L as CSV or paste the key numbers. For field names and query approach, see [reference/connector-queries.md](reference/connector-queries.md).

### 2. Ask about prior estimated payments

Before calculating, ask: "How much have you already paid in estimated taxes so far this year?" If the user doesn't know, note that you'll calculate total liability — they can subtract payments themselves or check with their accountant.

### 3. Calculate estimated liability

See [reference/calculation-assumptions.md](reference/calculation-assumptions.md) for the full math and the assumptions table you must include in output.

Short version:
1. **SE tax** = net profit × 0.9235 × 0.153 (then halve it — the deductible half offsets income)
2. **Adjusted net** = net profit − (SE tax / 2)
3. **Federal income tax** = apply the bracket rate appropriate to the user's business type and estimated annual income (default to 22% unless the user tells you their bracket; note this assumption explicitly)
4. **Total annual liability** = federal income tax + SE tax
5. **Quarterly payment** = (total annual liability − payments made) ÷ quarters remaining
6. **Safe harbor check** — note whether the user should verify against prior-year tax (100% of prior year, or 110% if AGI > $150k)

### 4. State assumptions and deliver output

Use this output structure:

Structure the output as a document with these sections in order:

1. **Header** — H2 with "Estimated tax summary" followed by the quarter and year.
   Subline: prepared date and "For review by your accountant."

2. **YTD snapshot** — Bold lines showing YTD net profit with date range,
   estimated annual net profit (annualized from YTD), and assumed business type
   (sole proprietor, S-corp, etc. — flag as assumed, not confirmed).

3. **Self-employment tax** — Show the SE tax calculation: net profit times
   92.35% times 15.3%, and the deductible SE half.

4. **Federal income tax estimate** — Adjusted net income, assumed bracket
   (default 22%, note to confirm with accountant), and the federal estimate.

5. **Total estimated annual liability** — SE tax plus federal income tax.

6. **Quarterly payment** — Total liability minus payments already made, divided
   by quarters remaining, with the specific dollar amount due and the due date.

7. **Safe harbor note** — Remind the owner to ensure total payments meet 100%
   of prior-year tax (or 110% if AGI exceeded $150k).

8. **Assumptions** — Bullet list of every assumption: bracket rate, business
   structure, state taxes excluded, deductible SE half included, and deductions
   not applied (home office, QBI, depreciation).

## Path 2: Year-end 1099 prep

### 1. Pull contractor payments from all sources

Query each connected source for **all payments made to individuals or businesses for services** in the tax year. Do not include payments for goods, refunds, or internal transfers.

**QuickBooks — try live connector first, fall back to CSV if needed:**

1. **Try live connector.** Attempt to pull vendor-level payment records via the QuickBooks MCP. If the connector returns individual payee records with name, amount, and account category, use them directly and skip the CSV step.

2. **Detect aggregate-only response.** If the MCP returns only category-level totals (e.g. "Contract labor: $7,500" with no payee breakdown), the connector does not yet support vendor-level queries. In this case, prompt the user:

   > "QuickBooks returned summary data only — I need payee-level detail to build your 1099 list. Please export a **Transaction List by Vendor** report (QuickBooks → Reports → Expenses → Transaction List by Vendor, filtered to this tax year) and upload the CSV here. I'll process it automatically."

3. **Process CSV via Desktop connector.** Map columns: payee name, amount, date, payment method, EIN/SSN status. Follow the same aggregation and threshold logic below regardless of whether data came from the live connector or CSV.

> **Note for future connector versions:** If the QuickBooks MCP is upgraded to expose vendor payment records directly, step 1 will succeed and the CSV fallback will be skipped automatically. No changes to this skill are needed — the try-first logic handles it.

For field names and query approach, see [reference/connector-queries.md](reference/connector-queries.md).

**PayPal:** Pull all "Goods & Services" payments sent. Note: PayPal issues its own 1099-K to contractors above the threshold — flag these separately in output so the accountant can determine whether a 1099-NEC is also needed.

**Stripe:** Pull all transfers/payouts made to external parties. Same 1099-K caveat as PayPal applies.

**Desktop/CSV:** If the user uploads a CSV directly (without going through QuickBooks export), map columns: payee name, amount, date, payment method, EIN/SSN status.

### 2. Aggregate by payee

Combine across sources and sum payments by individual or business entity. Deduplicate by name (watch for "John Smith" vs "John A. Smith" — flag likely duplicates for human review rather than auto-merging).

### 3. Apply the $600 threshold

- **Flag for 1099-NEC:** any payee paid ≥ $600 for services (contractors, freelancers, consultants)
- **Flag for 1099-MISC:** any payee paid ≥ $600 for rent, attorney fees, prizes/awards
- **Near-threshold alert:** flag payees paid $400–$599 — close to the threshold, accountant may want to verify

Corporations (Inc., Corp., LLC taxed as C or S corp) generally do not need a 1099-NEC — note this but flag for accountant confirmation.

### 4. Check W-9 status

For each flagged payee, note whether a W-9 / EIN is on file in QuickBooks. Mark as:
- ✅ W-9 on file (EIN/SSN recorded in QuickBooks)
- ⚠️ Missing — W-9 not on file; must collect before filing
- ❓ Unknown — cannot determine from available data

### 5. Deliver the 1099 prep package

Use this structure:

Structure the 1099 prep output as a document with these sections:

1. **Header** — H2 with "1099 prep list" and the tax year. Subline: prepared
   date, "For review by your accountant," and "Not tax advice."

2. **Summary** — Bullet counts: total contractors paid, number requiring
   1099-NEC (at or above $600 for services), number missing W-9 (with filing
   deadline note for Jan 31), and number near-threshold flagged for review.

3. **1099-NEC candidates table** — Columns: payee name, total paid, data
   sources, W-9 status (on file / missing / unknown), and notes. Flag any
   payee paid via PayPal or Stripe with a note that the platform may issue
   its own 1099-K.

4. **Missing W-9 action list** — Numbered list of contractors who need to
   provide a W-9 before filing, with amounts paid and a reminder to request
   the form.

5. **Near-threshold table** — Payees paid $400-$599 flagged for accountant
   review, with a note to verify no additional payments were missed.

6. **Payment processor note** — Explain that PayPal and Stripe issue their own
   1099-K forms and the accountant should confirm whether a 1099-NEC is also
   needed for contractors paid exclusively through those platforms.

7. **Next steps checklist** — Action items for the accountant: collect missing
   W-9s, confirm unknowns, review near-threshold payees, verify corporation
   exemptions, confirm 1099-K overlap handling, file by January 31.

## Guardrails

- **Not tax advice.** Open every deliverable with this: "Prepared for review by your accountant — not tax advice." Include it in the document header, not just in chat.
- **State every assumption.** If you assumed a 22% bracket, say so. If you excluded state taxes, say so. The accountant will adjust; give them the levers.
- **Don't merge payees automatically.** Flag likely duplicates for human review.
- **Don't file anything.** The output is prep material. Filing is out of scope.
- **Corporation exemption is a judgment call.** Note it; don't auto-exclude.
