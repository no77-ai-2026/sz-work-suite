# design-critique

## 스킬 개요(상세)

구조화된 디자인 크리틱 — 사용성·위계·일관성 관점의 피드백을 제공합니다. 한국 표준 + UZ 듀얼 컨텍스트를 적용합니다.

**한국화 노트**: [경계] 개발 런타임 GAN 루프는 design-iteration-loop — 이 스킬은 단건 대화형 크리틱.

**도구 일반화**: 원문의 미국 SaaS 연동은 방법론으로만 계승한다 — 한국 실무에서는 연결된 커넥터·업로드 문서·사용자 제공 정보를 소스로 쓴다.

**UZ 컨텍스트**: UZ: 현지 신뢰 단서(전화번호·Telegram 버튼 노출 관습) 반영 여부를 크리틱 축에 추가. 상세는 `references/uz-design-critique.md`.

## Usage

```
/design-critique $ARGUMENTS
```

Review the design: @$1

If a Figma URL is provided, pull the design from Figma. If a file is referenced, read it. Otherwise, ask the user to describe or share their design.

## What I Need From You

- **The design**: Figma URL, screenshot, or detailed description
- **Context**: What is this? Who is it for? What stage (exploration, refinement, final)?
- **Focus** (optional): "Focus on mobile" or "Focus on the onboarding flow"

## Critique Framework

### 1. First Impression (2 seconds)
- What draws the eye first? Is that correct?
- What's the emotional reaction?
- Is the purpose immediately clear?

### 2. Usability
- Can the user accomplish their goal?
- Is the navigation intuitive?
- Are interactive elements obvious?
- Are there unnecessary steps?

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- Is there a clear reading order?
- Are the right elements emphasized?
- Is whitespace used effectively?
- Is typography creating the right hierarchy?

### 4. Consistency
- Does it follow the design system?
- Are spacing, colors, and typography consistent?
- Do similar elements behave similarly?

### 5. Accessibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes
- Text readability
- Alternative text for images

## How to Give Feedback

- **Be specific**: "The CTA competes with the navigation" not "the layout is confusing"
- **Explain why**: Connect feedback to design principles or user needs
- **Suggest alternatives**: Don't just identify problems, propose solutions
- **Acknowledge what works**: Good feedback includes positive observations
- **Match the stage**: Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish

- **Text readability**: [Font size, line height]

### What Works Well
- [Positive observation 1]
- [Positive observation 2]

### Priority Recommendations
1. **[Most impactful change]** — [Why and how]
2. **[Second priority]** — [Why and how]
3. **[Third priority]** — [Why and how]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Pull the design directly from Figma and inspect components, tokens, and layers
- Compare against the existing design system for consistency

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Cross-reference design decisions with recent user feedback and support tickets

## Tips

1. **Share the context** — "This is a checkout flow for a B2B SaaS" helps me give relevant feedback.
2. **Specify your stage** — Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish.
3. **Ask me to focus** — "Just look at the navigation" gives you more depth on one area.
