# task-management

## 스킬 개요(상세)

TASKS.md 단일 파일 기반의 단순 태스크 관리 — 할 일 추가·완료·정리와 HTML 대시보드 뷰를 제공합니다. 한국 표준 + UZ 듀얼 컨텍스트를 적용합니다.

**한국화 노트**: 원본 start(초기 설정)·update(동기화) 커맨드 병합. dashboard.html 자산 포함. [경계] 목표 설계는 sz:goal-planner, 시간 설계는 sz:time-system.

**도구 일반화**: 원문의 미국 SaaS 연동(QuickBooks·HubSpot·PayPal·Gusto 등)은 방법론으로만 계승한다 — 한국 실무에서는 스마트스토어·카페24 MCP(gil-commerce 설치 시), 엑셀/CSV 업로드, 사용자 제공 수치를 소스로 쓰고, 해당 커넥터가 연결된 경우에만 직접 조회한다.

**UZ 컨텍스트**: UZ: 다국어 태스크 표기 혼용(KO/RU) 환경에서 태그 규칙 제안. 상세는 `references/uz-task-management.md`.

## 원문 방법론 (EN, knowledge-work-plugins)

<!-- source: productivity/task-management -->
# Task Management

Tasks are tracked in a simple `TASKS.md` file that both you and the user can edit.

## File Location

**Always use `TASKS.md` in the current working directory.**

- If it exists, read/write to it
- If it doesn't exist, create it with the template below

## Dashboard Setup (First Run)

A visual dashboard is available for managing tasks and memory. **On first interaction with tasks:**

1. Check if `dashboard.html` exists in the current working directory
2. If not, copy it from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dashboard.html` to the current working directory
3. Inform the user: "I've added the dashboard. Run `/productivity:start` to set up the full system."

The task board:
- Reads and writes to the same `TASKS.md` file
- Auto-saves changes
- Watches for external changes (syncs when you edit via CLI)
- Supports drag-and-drop reordering of tasks and sections

## Format & Template

When creating a new TASKS.md, use this exact template (without example tasks):

```markdown
# Tasks

## Active

## Waiting On

## Someday

## Done
```

Task format:
- `- [ ] **Task title** - context, for whom, due date`
- Sub-bullets for additional details
- Completed: `- [x] ~~Task~~ (date)`

## How to Interact

**When user asks "what's on my plate" / "my tasks":**
- Read TASKS.md
- Summarize Active and Waiting On sections
- Highlight anything overdue or urgent

**When user says "add a task" / "remind me to":**
- Add to Active section with `- [ ] **Task**` format
- Include context if provided (who it's for, due date)

**When user says "done with X" / "finished X":**
- Find the task
- Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Add strikethrough: `~~task~~`
- Add completion date
- Move to Done section

**When user asks "what am I waiting on":**
- Read the Waiting On section
- Note how long each item has been waiting

## Conventions

- **Bold** the task title for scannability
- Include "for [person]" when it's a commitment to someone
- Include "due [date]" for deadlines
- Include "since [date]" for waiting items
- Sub-bullets for additional context
- Keep Done section for ~1 week, then clear old items

## Extracting Tasks

When summarizing meetings or conversations, offer to add extracted tasks:
- Commitments the user made ("I'll send that over")
- Action items assigned to them
- Follow-ups mentioned

Ask before adding - don't auto-add without confirmation.

# Start Command

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Initialize the task and memory systems, then open the unified dashboard.

## Instructions

### 1. Check What Exists

Check the working directory for:
- `TASKS.md` — task list
- `CLAUDE.md` — working memory
- `memory/` — deep memory directory
- `dashboard.html` — the visual UI

### 2. Create What's Missing

**If `TASKS.md` doesn't exist:** Create it with the standard template (see task-management skill). Place it in the current working directory.

**If `dashboard.html` doesn't exist:** Copy it from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dashboard.html` to the current working directory.

**If `CLAUDE.md` and `memory/` don't exist:** This is a fresh setup — after opening the dashboard, begin the memory bootstrap workflow (see below). Place these in the current working directory.

### 3. Open the Dashboard

Do NOT use `open` or `xdg-open` — in Cowork, the agent runs in a VM and shell open commands won't reach the user's browser. Instead, tell the user: "Dashboard is ready at `dashboard.html`. Open it from your file browser to get started."

### 4. Orient the User

If everything was already initialized:
```
Dashboard open. Your tasks and memory are both loaded.
- /productivity:update to sync tasks and check memory
- /productivity:update --comprehensive for a deep scan of all activity
```

If memory hasn't been bootstrapped yet, continue to step 5.

### 5. Bootstrap Memory (First Run Only)

Only do this if `CLAUDE.md` and `memory/` don't exist yet.

The best source of workplace language is the user's actual task list. Real tasks = real shorthand.

**Ask the user:**
```
Where do you keep your todos or task list? This could be:
- A local file (e.g., TASKS.md, todo.txt)
- An app (e.g. Asana, Linear, Jira, Notion, Todoist)
- A notes file

I'll use your tasks to learn your workplace shorthand.
```

**Once you have access to the task list:**

For each task item, analyze it for potential shorthand:
- Names that might be nicknames
- Acronyms or abbreviations
- Project references or codenames
- Internal terms or jargon

**For each item, decode it interactively:**

```
Task: "Send PSR to Todd re: Phoenix blockers"

I see some terms I want to make sure I understand:

1. **PSR** - What does this stand for?
2. **Todd** - Who is Todd? (full name, role)
3. **Phoenix** - Is this a project codename? What's it about?
```

Continue through each task, asking only about terms you haven't already decoded.

### 6. Optional Comprehensive Scan

After task list decoding, offer:
```
Do you want me to do a comprehensive scan of your messages, emails, and documents?
This takes longer but builds much richer context about the people, projects, and terms in your work.

Or we can stick with what we have and add context later.
```

**If they choose comprehensive scan:**

Gather data from available MCP sources:
- **Chat:** Recent messages, channels, DMs
- **Email:** Sent messages, recipients
- **Documents:** Recent docs, collaborators
- **Calendar:** Meetings, attendees

Build a braindump of people, projects, and terms found. Present findings grouped by confidence:
- **Ready to add** (high confidence) — offer to add directly
- **Needs clarification** — ask the user
- **Low frequency / unclear** — note for later

### 7. Write Memory Files

From everything gathered, create:

**CLAUDE.md** (working memory, ~50-80 lines):
```markdown
# Memory

## Me
[Name], [Role] on [Team].

## People
| Who | Role |
|-----|------|
| **[Nickname]** | [Full Name], [role] |

## Terms
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| [acronym] | [expansion] |

## Projects
| Name | What |
|------|------|
| **[Codename]** | [description] |

## Preferences
- [preferences discovered]
```

**memory/** directory:
- `memory/glossary.md` — full decoder ring (acronyms, terms, nicknames, codenames)
- `memory/people/{name}.md` — individual profiles
- `memory/projects/{name}.md` — project details
- `memory/context/company.md` — teams, tools, processes

### 8. Report Results

```
Productivity system ready:
- Tasks: TASKS.md (X items)
- Memory: X people, X terms, X projects
- Dashboard: open in browser

Use /productivity:update to keep things current (add --comprehensive for a deep scan).
```

## Notes

- If memory is already initialized, this just opens the dashboard
- Nicknames are critical — always capture how people are actually referred to
- If a source isn't available, skip it and note the gap
- Memory grows organically through natural conversation after bootstrap

<!-- source: productivity/update -->
# Update Command

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Keep your task list and memory current. Two modes:

- **Default:** Sync tasks from external tools, triage stale items, check memory for gaps
- **`--comprehensive`:** Deep scan chat, email, calendar, docs — flag missed todos and suggest new memories

## Usage

```bash
/productivity:update
/productivity:update --comprehensive
```

## Default Mode

### 1. Load Current State

Read `TASKS.md` and `memory/` directory. If they don't exist, suggest `/productivity:start` first.

### 2. Sync Tasks from External Sources

Check for available task sources:
- **Project tracker** (e.g. Asana, Linear, Jira) (if MCP available)
- **GitHub Issues** (if in a repo): `gh issue list --assignee=@me`

If no sources are available, skip to Step 3.

**Fetch tasks assigned to the user** (open/in-progress). Compare against TASKS.md:

| External task | TASKS.md match? | Action |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Found, not in TASKS.md | No match | Offer to add |
| Found, already in TASKS.md | Match by title (fuzzy) | Skip |
| In TASKS.md, not in external | No match | Flag as potentially stale |
| Completed externally | In Active section | Offer to mark done |

Present diff and let user decide what to add/complete.

### 3. Triage Stale Items

Review Active tasks in TASKS.md and flag:
- Tasks with due dates in the past
- Tasks in Active for 30+ days
- Tasks with no context (no person, no project)

Present each for triage: Mark done? Reschedule? Move to Someday?

### 4. Decode Tasks for Memory Gaps

For each task, attempt to decode all entities (people, projects, acronyms, tools, links):

```
Task: "Send PSR to Todd re: Phoenix blockers"

Decode:
- PSR → ✓ Pipeline Status Report (in glossary)
- Todd → ✓ Todd Martinez (in people/)
- Phoenix → ? Not in memory
```

Track what's fully decoded vs. what has gaps.

### 5. Fill Gaps

Present unknown terms grouped:
```
I found terms in your tasks I don't have context for:

1. "Phoenix" (from: "Send PSR to Todd re: Phoenix blockers")
   → What's Phoenix?

2. "Maya" (from: "sync with Maya on API design")
   → Who is Maya?
```

Add answers to the appropriate memory files (people/, projects/, glossary.md).

### 6. Capture Enrichment

Tasks often contain richer context than memory. Extract and update:
- **Links** from tasks → add to project/people files
- **Status changes** ("launch done") → update project status, demote from CLAUDE.md
- **Relationships** ("Todd's sign-off on Maya's proposal") → cross-reference people
- **Deadlines** → add to project files

### 7. Report

```
Update complete:
- Tasks: +3 from project tracker (e.g. Asana), 1 completed, 2 triaged
- Memory: 2 gaps filled, 1 project enriched
- All tasks decoded ✓
```

## Comprehensive Mode (`--comprehensive`)

Everything in Default Mode, plus a deep scan of recent activity.

### Extra Step: Scan Activity Sources

Gather data from available MCP sources:
- **Chat:** Search recent messages, read active channels
- **Email:** Search sent messages
- **Documents:** List recently touched docs
- **Calendar:** List recent + upcoming events

### Extra Step: Flag Missed Todos

Compare activity against TASKS.md. Surface action items that aren't tracked:

```
## Possible Missing Tasks

From your activity, these look like todos you haven't captured:

1. From chat (Jan 18):
   "I'll send the updated mockups by Friday"
   → Add to TASKS.md?

2. From meeting "Phoenix Standup" (Jan 17):
   You have a recurring meeting but no Phoenix tasks active
   → Anything needed here?

3. From email (Jan 16):
   "I'll review the API spec this week"
   → Add to TASKS.md?
```

Let user pick which to add.

### Extra Step: Suggest New Memories

Surface new entities not in memory:

```
## New People (not in memory)
| Name | Frequency | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Maya Rodriguez | 12 mentions | design, UI reviews |
| Alex K | 8 mentions | DMs about API |

## New Projects/Topics
| Name | Frequency | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Starlight | 15 mentions | planning docs, product |

## Suggested Cleanup
- **Horizon project** — No mentions in 30 days. Mark completed?
```

Present grouped by confidence. High-confidence items offered to add directly; low-confidence items asked about.

## Notes

- Never auto-add tasks or memories without user confirmation
- External source links are preserved when available
- Fuzzy matching on task titles handles minor wording differences
- Safe to run frequently — only updates when there's new info
- `--comprehensive` always runs interactively
