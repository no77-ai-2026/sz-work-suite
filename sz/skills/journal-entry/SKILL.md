# journal-entry

## 스킬 개요(상세)

분개 준비 — 차변·대변과 증빙을 갖춘 월 마감 분개(미지급·선급·급여 발생액 등)를 작성합니다. 한국 표준 + UZ 듀얼 컨텍스트를 적용합니다.

**한국화 노트**: 원본 journal-entry-prep 병합. 한국 재맥락: K-IFRS/일반기업회계기준 계정과목 체계, 전표(대체/입금/출금) 관행. [경계] 결산 총괄은 sz:close-management, 재무제표는 sz:financial-statements.

**도구 일반화**: 원문의 미국 SaaS 연동은 방법론으로만 계승한다 — 한국 실무에서는 연결된 커넥터·업로드 문서·사용자 제공 정보를 소스로 쓴다.

**UZ 컨텍스트**: UZ: NAS(국가회계기준) 계정 코드 체계 병기. 상세는 `references/uz-journal-entry.md`.

Prepare journal entries with proper debits, credits, supporting detail, and review documentation.

## Usage

```
/je <type> <period>
```

### Arguments

- `type` — The journal entry type. One of:
  - `ap-accrual` — Accounts payable accruals for goods/services received but not yet invoiced
  - `fixed-assets` — Depreciation and amortization entries for fixed assets and intangibles
  - `prepaid` — Amortization of prepaid expenses (insurance, software, rent, etc.)
  - `payroll` — Payroll accruals including salaries, benefits, taxes, and bonus accruals
  - `revenue` — Revenue recognition entries including deferred revenue adjustments
- `period` — The accounting period (e.g., `2024-12`, `2024-Q4`, `2024`)

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Source Data

If ~~erp or ~~data warehouse is connected:
- Pull the trial balance for the specified period
- Pull subledger detail for the relevant accounts
- Pull prior period entries of the same type for reference
- Identify the current GL balances for affected accounts

If no data source is connected:
> Connect ~~erp or ~~data warehouse to pull GL data automatically. You can also paste trial balance data or upload a spreadsheet.

Prompt the user to provide:
- Trial balance or GL balances for affected accounts
- Subledger detail or supporting schedules
- Prior period entries for reference (optional)

### 2. Calculate the Entry

Based on the JE type:

**AP Accrual:**
- Identify goods/services received but not invoiced by period end
- Calculate accrual amounts from PO receipts, contracts, or estimates
- Debit: Expense accounts (or asset accounts for capitalizable items)
- Credit: Accrued liabilities

**Fixed Assets:**
- Pull the fixed asset register or depreciation schedule
- Calculate period depreciation by asset class and method (straight-line, declining balance, units of production)
- Debit: Depreciation expense (by department/cost center)
- Credit: Accumulated depreciation

**Prepaid:**
- Pull the prepaid amortization schedule
- Calculate the period amortization for each prepaid item
- Debit: Expense accounts (by type — insurance, software, rent, etc.)
- Credit: Prepaid expense accounts

**Payroll:**
- Calculate accrued salaries for days worked but not yet paid
- Calculate accrued benefits (health, retirement contributions, PTO)
- Calculate employer payroll tax accruals
- Calculate bonus accruals (if applicable, based on plan terms)
- Debit: Salary expense, benefits expense, payroll tax expense
- Credit: Accrued payroll, accrued benefits, accrued payroll taxes

**Revenue:**
- Review contracts and performance obligations
- Calculate revenue to recognize based on delivery/performance
- Adjust deferred revenue balances
- Debit: Deferred revenue (or accounts receivable)
- Credit: Revenue accounts (by stream/category)

### 3. Generate the Journal Entry

Present the entry in standard format:

```
Journal Entry: [Type] — [Period]
Prepared by: [User]
Date: [Period end date]

| Line | Account Code | Account Name | Debit | Credit | Department | Memo |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|--------|------------|------|
| 1    | XXXX        | [Name]       | X,XXX |        | [Dept]     | [Detail] |
| 2    | XXXX        | [Name]       |       | X,XXX  | [Dept]     | [Detail] |
|      |             | **Total**    | X,XXX | X,XXX  |            |      |

Supporting Detail:
- [Calculation basis and assumptions]
- [Reference to supporting schedule or documentation]

Reversal: [Yes/No — if yes, specify reversal date]
```

### 4. Review Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Debits equal credits
- [ ] Correct accounting period
- [ ] Account codes are valid and map to the right GL accounts
- [ ] Amounts are calculated correctly with supporting detail
- [ ] Memo/description is clear and specific enough for audit
- [ ] Department/cost center coding is correct
- [ ] Entry is consistent with prior period treatment
- [ ] Reversal flag is set appropriately (accruals should auto-reverse)
- [ ] Supporting documentation is referenced or attached
- [ ] Entry is within the user's approval authority
- [ ] No unusual or out-of-pattern amounts that need investigation

### 5. Output

Provide:
1. The formatted journal entry
2. Supporting calculations
3. Comparison to prior period entry of the same type (if available)
4. Any items flagged for review or follow-up
5. Instructions for posting (manual entry or upload format for the user's ERP)

# Journal Entry Preparation

**Important**: This skill assists with journal entry workflows but does not provide financial advice. All entries should be reviewed by qualified financial professionals before posting.

Best practices, standard entry types, documentation requirements, and review workflows for journal entry preparation.

## Standard Accrual Types and Their Entries

### Accounts Payable Accruals

Accrue for goods or services received but not yet invoiced at period end.

**Typical entry:**
- Debit: Expense account (or capitalize if asset-qualifying)
- Credit: Accrued liabilities

**Sources for calculation:**
- Open purchase orders with confirmed receipts
- Contracts with services rendered but unbilled
- Recurring vendor arrangements (utilities, subscriptions, professional services)
- Employee expense reports submitted but not yet processed

**Key considerations:**
- Reverse in the following period (auto-reversal recommended)
- Use consistent estimation methodology period over period
- Document basis for estimates (PO amount, contract terms, historical run-rate)
- Track actual vs accrual to refine future estimates

### Fixed Asset Depreciation

Book periodic depreciation expense for tangible and intangible assets.

**Typical entry:**
- Debit: Depreciation/amortization expense (by department or cost center)
- Credit: Accumulated depreciation/amortization

**Depreciation methods:**
- **Straight-line:** (Cost - Salvage) / Useful life — most common for financial reporting
- **Declining balance:** Accelerated method applying fixed rate to net book value
- **Units of production:** Based on actual usage or output vs total expected

**Key considerations:**
- Run depreciation from the fixed asset register or schedule
- Verify new additions are set up with correct useful life and method
- Check for disposals or impairments requiring write-off
- Ensure consistency between book and tax depreciation tracking

### Prepaid Expense Amortization

Amortize prepaid expenses over their benefit period.

**Typical entry:**
- Debit: Expense account (insurance, software, rent, etc.)
- Credit: Prepaid expense

**Common prepaid categories:**
- Insurance premiums (typically 12-month policies)
- Software licenses and subscriptions
- Prepaid rent (if applicable under lease terms)
- Prepaid maintenance contracts
- Conference and event deposits

**Key considerations:**
- Maintain an amortization schedule with start/end dates and monthly amounts
- Review for any prepaid items that should be fully expensed (immaterial amounts)
- Check for cancelled or terminated contracts requiring accelerated amortization
- Verify new prepaids are added to the schedule promptly

### Payroll Accruals

Accrue compensation and related costs for the period.

**Typical entries:**

*Salary accrual (for pay periods not aligned with month-end):*
- Debit: Salary expense (by department)
- Credit: Accrued payroll

*Bonus accrual:*
- Debit: Bonus expense (by department)
- Credit: Accrued bonus

*Benefits accrual:*
- Debit: Benefits expense
- Credit: Accrued benefits

*Payroll tax accrual:*
- Debit: Payroll tax expense
- Credit: Accrued payroll taxes

**Key considerations:**
- Calculate salary accrual based on working days in the period vs pay period
- Bonus accruals should reflect plan terms (target amounts, performance metrics, payout timing)
- Include employer-side taxes and benefits (FICA, FUTA, health, 401k match)
- Track PTO/vacation accrual liability if required by policy or jurisdiction

### Revenue Recognition

Recognize revenue based on performance obligations and delivery.

**Typical entries:**

*Recognize previously deferred revenue:*
- Debit: Deferred revenue
- Credit: Revenue

*Recognize revenue with new receivable:*
- Debit: Accounts receivable
- Credit: Revenue

*Defer revenue received in advance:*
- Debit: Cash / Accounts receivable
- Credit: Deferred revenue

**Key considerations:**
- Follow ASC 606 five-step framework for contracts with customers
- Identify distinct performance obligations in each contract
- Determine transaction price (including variable consideration)
- Allocate transaction price to performance obligations
- Recognize revenue as/when performance obligations are satisfied
- Maintain contract-level detail for audit support

## Supporting Documentation Requirements

Every journal entry should have:

1. **Entry description/memo:** Clear, specific description of what the entry records and why
2. **Calculation support:** How amounts were derived (formula, schedule, source data reference)
3. **Source documents:** Reference to the underlying transactions or events (PO numbers, invoice numbers, contract references, payroll register)
4. **Period:** The accounting period the entry applies to
5. **Preparer identification:** Who prepared the entry and when
6. **Approval:** Evidence of review and approval per the authorization matrix
7. **Reversal indicator:** Whether the entry auto-reverses and the reversal date

## Review and Approval Workflows

### Typical Approval Matrix

| Entry Type | Amount Threshold | Approver |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Standard recurring | Any amount | Accounting manager |
| Non-recurring / manual | < $50K | Accounting manager |
| Non-recurring / manual | $50K - $250K | Controller |
| Non-recurring / manual | > $250K | CFO / VP Finance |
| Top-side / consolidation | Any amount | Controller or above |
| Out-of-period adjustments | Any amount | Controller or above |

*Note: Thresholds should be set based on your organization's materiality and risk tolerance.*

### Review Checklist

Before approving a journal entry, the reviewer should verify:

- [ ] Debits equal credits (entry is balanced)
- [ ] Correct accounting period (not posting to a closed period)
- [ ] Account codes exist and are appropriate for the transaction
- [ ] Amounts are mathematically accurate and supported by calculations
- [ ] Description is clear, specific, and sufficient for audit purposes
- [ ] Department/cost center/project coding is correct
- [ ] Treatment is consistent with prior periods and accounting policies
- [ ] Auto-reversal is set appropriately (accruals should reverse)
- [ ] Supporting documentation is complete and referenced
- [ ] Entry amount is within the preparer's authority level
- [ ] No duplicate of an existing entry
- [ ] Unusual or large amounts are explained and justified

## Common Errors to Check For

1. **Unbalanced entries:** Debits do not equal credits (system should prevent, but check manual entries)
2. **Wrong period:** Entry posted to an incorrect or already-closed period
3. **Wrong sign:** Debit entered as credit or vice versa
4. **Duplicate entries:** Same transaction recorded twice (check for duplicates before posting)
5. **Wrong account:** Entry posted to incorrect GL account (especially similar account codes)
6. **Missing reversal:** Accrual entry not set to auto-reverse, causing double-counting
7. **Stale accruals:** Recurring accruals not updated for changed circumstances
8. **Round-number estimates:** Suspiciously round amounts that may not reflect actual calculations
9. **Incorrect FX rates:** Foreign currency entries using wrong exchange rate or date
10. **Missing intercompany elimination:** Entries between entities without corresponding elimination
11. **Capitalization errors:** Expenses that should be capitalized, or capitalized items that should be expensed
12. **Cut-off errors:** Transactions recorded in the wrong period based on delivery or service date
